The p-value you want is the probability of getting 100 or more white balls in a sample of size 400 from an urn with 3000 white balls and 12000 black balls. Here are four ways to calculate it.


The central hypothesis tested in Pen Ìƒagaricano et al. (2013) using RNA-Seq was that maternal methionine supplementation around conception can produce epigenetic changes (e.g. DNA methylation) in the fetal  genome leading to changes in gene expression in early embryos.
This tables shows statistically significant ...
The hypothesis was supported by the
MeSH heading Transcription, Genetic (MeSH:D014158) in
the Phenomena and Processes category, whereas similar
concepts were not picked up by GO terms .


So one  question you may have is what we can do with MeSH?
The first thing we can do is that we can  perform MeSH enrichment analysis which is similar to GO enrichemnt analysis by 
using hypergeometric test. The hypergoemetric test is commonly used when we want to see wheter certain 
annotations are enriched or not. 
In GO enrihment anlaysis basically we perform this hypgenometric test for each GO terms but 
here we replace GO with MeSH terms. 
 
# Secondly, we can compute semantic similarity among MeSH terms. 
So MesH terms are organized in hierchical structure and we can leverage
this strucure to compute semantic similar between two MeSH terms.
This is a similarity between two MesH terms based on their biological meanings  of annotation and the closer two terms are in the hierarchy, the higher the similarity measure is between these terms.
By using this information, we can also compute semantic similarity among genes  based on their assigned MeSH annotations. 
And GO terms are also organized in hiherchiel strucuture so we can also appy this 
to g GO terms.
